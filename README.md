# APITTask2
In this task I was asked to make network call to fetch some data from API and show it on a tableview with some operations that the user can do like adding ,deleting and updating cells of tableview
and a refresher which enables the user to fetch the original data again and ignore what the user have done from addition , deleting or updating
